> A Best-of-Both-Worlds of HPC and Cloud

This is the Converged Computing working space. It includes definitions, projects, and eventually will also include a [CiSE Special Issue](https://www.authorea.com/users/34995/articles/430859-cise-guest-editors-guide) on converged computing. 

## Overview

> Special Issue Anticipated for mid 2024

Major trends have brought the cloud and high performance computing (HPC) communities closer together: the maturation of cloud technologies has shifted focus toward running workloads efficiently, and composite scientific workflows and resource heterogeneity and dynamism have revealed the limitations of traditional HPC resource and workflow management. It has become clear that the initially disparate communities have much to benefit in working together. This special issue aims to bridge the gap between HPC and cloud to discuss work in converged computing – the collaborative space between these traditionally separate communities – to develop novel technologies and applications. These hybrid technologies might span the gamut from automation, workflows, containerization, to software development and deployment and testing. This is a timely topic as collaborative work is happening to a greater degree that combines approaches from high performance computing with cloud-native computing.
