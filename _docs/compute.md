Computing is changing information (i.e., bits) in time. Compute resources can be connected to each other via a network, and can transmit the results of computation to storage.

## Example

A computing processor such as a general-purpose CPU executes instructions to transform bits. The rate at which instructions can transform bits is a fundamental measure of computing performance. Specialized computing processors such as GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs, and others are designed to sacrifice general-purpose performance for higher performance on more specialized instructions or types of bit transformations. Access to computing resources can be physical or virtual.
