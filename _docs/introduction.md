### What is Converged Computing?

We have vision for a future where the cloud and high performance computing communities are working together, and learning from one another to build new technologies that combine the best of both worlds. If you think about it, the area between cloud and HPC is muddled at best, akin to a “fog of war” in your favorite computer game. We aim to shed some light on this fog, and map out the landscape that will make it possible to easily move workloads between cloud and HPC environments. We plan to tackle issues that range from:

- job orchestration and management
- resource management
- scheduling
- ensembles

and more! This is a <a href="https://vsoch.github.io/2018/interactive-posts/" target="_blank">living document</a> that should be updated when needed and represent a current state of thinking.

### Why do we need to work together?

This is a collaboration between the HPC and cloud native (industry) communities to derive definitions for converged computing. We are starting with high level definitions that will populate a website on converged computing (hosted at our converged-computing GitHub, branded professionally) and associated videos on YouTube. We will present the landscape of these terms, first at a high level, and then drill down into each with details about what it means for HPC vs. Kubernetes. This work is an important collaborative effort to present definitions and concepts that account for the experience of both communities!
