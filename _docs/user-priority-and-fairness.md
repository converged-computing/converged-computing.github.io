We don't keep a historical record, but rather give resources based on who deserves what at any particular instant. This is an instantaneous measurement rather than one tracked over time. [[ref](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/papers/2011/nsdi_drf.pdf)]

An example comes from [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/priority_multifactor.html)

Both priority and fairness impact how queueing is done.
