Tools and methods to keep track of the status/state of a system and/or applications running on it. Likely, strategies for monitoring of systems are different from those that monitor applications. This definition might be handled based on "SRE" type questions - what happens when a node goes down? A node vs. a pod vs. an application? What happens if there is a security vulnerability?
